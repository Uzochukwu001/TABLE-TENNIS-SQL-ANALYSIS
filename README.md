# TABLE-TENNIS SQL ANALYSIS


## Exploratory Data Analysis of a mod table tennis data using SQL.



This is a challenge to create a mod dataset and explore it using SQL queries. 

The challenge tasks can be found in the appended pdf file and the utilised codes for exploration can be found in the .sql file attached. 

Each task was spotlighted below with its appropriate image and the following data exploration steps were conducted using MS SQL Server:

-Creation of the mod tables with the right column namings in an appropriate schema. The relationship among the three tables was modelled using the 'manage relationship' tab on the Tools bar; on their respective PKs and FKs.

-Insertion of the different datapoints into the right tables and format.

-Show the average score of each player, even if they didn't play any games. Expected output (Player ID, Name, Average score)
